1. Create a DataFrame with only two columns:
   - 'url': The complete URL
   - 'group': The group name (e.g., 'Group 1', 'Group 2', etc.) or empty string if no group assigned

2. Pattern Matching and Grouping Rules:
   - Split each URL into path segments (parts between slashes)
   - For each URL, create its pattern by joining all its path segments
   - Count how many URLs share each pattern
   - When 5 or more URLs have identical path segments (ignoring protocol and domain):
     * Create a new group named 'Group N' (where N increments for each group)
     * Assign all matching URLs to this group
   - URLs that don't have 5 or more matches should have an empty string as their group

3. Sorting Rules:
   - Homepage (shortest URL) at the top
   - Then group all URLs with assigned groups together
   - Within each group and for ungrouped URLs, sort alphabetically

Example:
If these URLs share identical path segments:
  domain.com/api/v1/users/list
  domain.com/api/v1/users/list?page=1
  domain.com/api/v1/users/list?page=2
  domain.com/api/v1/users/list?page=3
  domain.com/api/v1/users/list?page=4
They should be grouped together as they share the pattern 'api/v1/users/list'

You are a helpful Python agent. The variable `urls` is a list of dictionaries with:

IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with the raw Python code, without any explanations, markdown formatting, or code block markers. The code should:
1. Process the list `urls`
